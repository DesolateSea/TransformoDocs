      2. Extract only the information specified in the extraction fields.
      3. Maintain the structure provided in the extraction fields.
      4. If certain information is not available in the document, use null or empty arrays as appropriate.

      6. For nested fields, extract all subfields as specified.
      7. If the document type is not recognized or no specific extraction fields are provided, extract general information that seems most relevant to the document's content.
