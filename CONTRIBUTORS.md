### Nishant Mohan ([Nishant040305](https://github.com/Nishant040305))

- [Frontend] Contributed extensively to the React frontendâ€”authentication flows, styling, UI components (e.g. uploaders, progress bars), Redux-based state management, and dark/light themes.
- [Python] Developed and integrated the LLM-based data extraction and prompt-response agent using Python (Flask) and TypeScript services.
- [Python] Designed and implemented core NLP pipelines and ML services including document segmentation, query parsing, and extraction strategy logic.
- [Spring/Python] Built the document upload and processing logic and its integration with backend OCR + LLM modules.
- [Frontend] Handled frontend-backend connectivity, route protection, token management, and overall UX flow.
- [Frontend] Created developer-focused utilities such as ML service wrappers, download/export services, and tutorial UI sections.
- [Spring/Frontend] Led bug fixes and implementation around file services, multi-part upload support, and API correctness.

### Shivam Aryan ([Aryan10](https://github.com/Aryan10))

- [Spring] Implemented the Spring Boot backend architecture including authentication, file upload/download, and secure API endpoints.
- [Spring] Designed and integrated JWT-based authentication, route protection, and user verification with OTP using Spring Mail and Redis.
- [Spring] Built REST APIs for document ingestion, NLP-based querying, and file metadata management.
- [Spring/Python] Integrated Python microservices using HTTP clients with clean abstractions for OCR and LLM-based querying.
- [Spring] Wrote automated tests for backend; added input validation and exception handling using Springâ€™s ControllerAdvice.
- [Spring] Documented the codebase and APIs using Springdoc and wrote scripts to automate OpenAPI-based documentation (Widdershins).
- [Spring] Refactored major modules to enforce clean architecture principles and maintainability.
- [Spring] Maintained environment-specific configuration and bootstrapped the DevTools setup.

### Uditansh Srivastava ([UditanshSri](https://github.com/UditanshSri))

- [Python] Implemented Flask-based OCR service for extracting text from scanned PDFs and images.
- [Python] Created utility scripts and notebooks for NER and sentiment analysis models.
- [Python] Designed the RandomForest-based document archiving predictor and integrated it with metadata.
- [Spring] Refactored global exception handling in Spring Boot (custom exception classes, centralized error responses).
- [Spring] Exposed CSRF token API for client-side compatibility and added `/health` endpoint for uptime monitoring.
- [Python] Contributed early ML documentation and modularized NLP endpoints.

### Darsh Shah ([DarshShah10](https://github.com/DarshShah10))

- [Frontend] Built the core structure of the React frontend UI using `index.tsx`, route handling, and file upload layout.
- [Frontend] Integrated basic frontend-to-backend communication during the early UI development phase.
- [Frontend] Assisted in layout design and onboarding CORS compatibility between frontend and backend.
- [Frontend] Contributed to project documentation and pull request integration.

### Shaurya Singh ([shauryasf](https://github.com/shauryasf))

- [Python] Set up the initial Python backend structure with Flask and configured core dependencies.
- [Python] Created early versions of `requirements.txt` and environmental scaffolding for OCR/NLP pipelines.
- [Python] Merged and maintained consistent requirements across contributors during early Python service development.
